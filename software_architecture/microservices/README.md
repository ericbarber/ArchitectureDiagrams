Microservices Architecture for Data Processing

    Description: Microservices architecture involves building a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. It is especially useful in distributed systems where different parts of the data processing pipeline can be scaled independently.
    Key Components: Microservices, API Gateway, Message Broker.
